# Ageing Study Analysis
This folder contains analyses of the four datasets on ageing research: two with young and old urine samples, the public portion of BLSA data, and the study on (un)healthy ageing. 
- [BLTA_ageing_validation.ipynb](https://github.com/rodvrees/Master_Thesis/blob/main/Ageing_study/BLTA_ageing_validation.ipynb): attempt to corroborate the upregulation of several oxPTMs using BLSA data
- [Unhealthy_ageing.ipynb](https://github.com/rodvrees/Master_Thesis/blob/main/Ageing_study/Unhealthy_ageing.ipynb): analysis of (un)healthy ageing study
- [quant_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/rodvrees/Master_Thesis/blob/main/Ageing_study/quant_analysis.ipynb): analysis of young vs. old urine samples
- [quant_preprocess.ipynb](https://github.com/rodvrees/Master_Thesis/blob/main/Ageing_study/quant_preprocess.ipynb): data preprocessing for above analysis
