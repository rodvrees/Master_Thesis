Phosphorylation of Ser-253 decreases DNA-binding activity and promotes the phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-316, permitting phosphorylation of Ser-319 and Ser-322, probably by CDK1, leading to nuclear exclusion and loss of function. Stress signals, such as response to oxygen or nitric oxide, attenuate the PKB/AKT1-mediated phosphorylation leading to nuclear retention.

Deacetylated by SIRT2 in response to oxidative stress or serum deprivation, thereby negatively regulating FOXO1-mediated autophagic cell death (By similarity). Once in the nucleus, acetylated by CREBBP/EP300. Acetylation diminishes the interaction with target DNA and attenuates the transcriptional activity. It increases the phosphorylation at Ser-253, and is required for the transcriptional inhibition by FCOR. Deacetylation by SIRT1 results in reactivation of the transcriptional activity (PubMed:17090532). Acetylation of FOXO1 diminishes its binding to PPARG in adipocytes. Deacetylated by SIRT2; deacetylation of FOXO1 directly increases its repressive binding to PPARG and inhibits adipocyte differentiation. Oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide treatment appears to promote deacetylation and uncoupling of insulin-induced phosphorylation.
