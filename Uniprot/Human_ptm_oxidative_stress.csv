In response to growth factors, phosphorylation on Thr-24, Ser-256 and Ser-322 by PKB/AKT1 promotes nuclear export and inactivation of transactivational activity. Phosphorylation on Thr-24 is required for binding 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser-256 decreases DNA-binding activity and promotes the phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319, permitting phosphorylation of Ser-322 and Ser-325, probably by CDK1, leading to nuclear exclusion and loss of function. Stress signals, such as response to oxygen or nitric oxide, attenuate the PKB/AKT1-mediated phosphorylation leading to nuclear retention. Phosphorylation of Ser-329 is independent of IGF1 and leads to reduced function. Dephosphorylated on Thr-24 and Ser-256 by PP2A in beta-cells under oxidative stress leading to nuclear retention (By similarity). Phosphorylation of Ser-249 by CDK1 disrupts binding of 14-3-3 proteins leading to nuclear accumulation and has no effect on DNA-binding nor transcriptional activity.

Such aggregates can be observed in vivo in the affected tissues of patients with Alzheimer disease or alcoholic liver cirrhosis, or in cell cultures during necrosis. Oxidation at Met-46 may play a pivotal role in the formation of these insoluble structures. This modification has been detected in vitro following treatment with free radical donor (+/-)-(E)-4-ethyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexenamide. It has been proposed to destabilize nearby residues, increasing the likelihood of secondary oxidative damages, including oxidation of Tyr-45 and Met-105.
